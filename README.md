# demo_blockchain

This little piece of code is here to show:
* What is a blockchain
* How does proof of work functions 
* What does the difficulty change

There is a Youtube video explaining these concepts and using this file.

This file is free to fork to present this demo to anyone.

It has been written by Isabelle Bonnet, CEO of Blockchain Solutions
